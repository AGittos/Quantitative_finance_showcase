    "## Quantative Finance project \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project was to recreate a long only moving-average quantative strategy which would allow me to showcase my ability in coding while also learning about various models and ideas in quantative finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project itself recreates a situation where an investor seeks over a year from 21-02-2018 to invest a sum N of capital in the S&P500. To make the project less computationally intensive, only the first 50 companies in the S&P500, arranged alphabetically by ticker, will be looked at.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project therefore consists of two main parts. The signal analysis, where the historical prices of each stock are  converted into a 50 day and 20 day exponential moving averages. Stocks are considered worth investing in on a particular day if the 20 day EMA is above the 50 day EMA. The risk in the stock is calculated as the standard deviation of historic returns up to that day. The portfolio will be assembled each day so that each stock that is invested in will present the same risk to the overall protfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trading gets done daily. Each day, all pervious positions get liquidated. and the total resulting available capital get calculated. A list is created of all companies with positive crossovers on that day. Then working down the positive crossover list, an investment is calculated for the chosen stocks till no capital remains. If the calculated investment for a stock is greater than the remaining capital, then the investment is changed to be equal to the remaining capital. If the end of the list of positive crossover stocks is reached before all capital is spent then the process is iterated through again until no more capital remains."

    "It works by iterating through each day of the year and calculating the list of positive crossover stocks, ordered from largest to smallest positive crossover. For each day of the year it then iterates through the list and calculates the amount that day to invest for the stock based on investing enough in each stock so that they each pose the same risk to the portfolio. More precisely they each are expected to lose the same amount over a given time frame for a given confidence level.\n",

    "Though this project has been a great learning experience, I have had, due to time and knowledge constraints, to make certain assumptions and limitations that affect the efficiency and validity of this system.\n",

    "Firstly, The EMA crossovers for each stock, which are what are used to order which stocks get priority for investment, have not been adjusted to be proportional to the price of the stock which would bias the system towards more expensive stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the risk calculations that tried to equalise the risk from each position were made slightly redundant by the fact that the system, sometimes had to loop back over the list and double the amount invested in some stocks just to spend all the available capital. This defeated the whole point that each stock would present the same risk to the portfolio, however this is more an issue with the restriction to 50 S&P500 companies as if all had been available the positive crossover list would hopefully have been long enough to make any double purchases unneccessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourthly, because my only signal is a simple EMA crossover, there can often be a lot of inefficient investing that comes from noise. A possible way to solve this might be to wait for at least two consecutive positive crossover days before investing but this could potentially also lose money by reacting slowly to positive trends and so mighnt only be effective with EMA's with longer lookbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly and most importantly, This system does not take into account any of the trading costs of liquidating the entire portfolio and reinvesting it every day. Even if this process was optimised to just trade the difference in positions between days the, difference to returns would be noticeable. "
